		Ideja se je porodila konec oktobra 2012 na dogodku v PopUp domu. Ob pogovoru z enim izmed ustanovitljev ljubljanskega coworkinga sem prišel na idejo, ki bi razširila ta koncept preko fizičnih meja, saj sem imel tudi sam v preteklosti problem iskanja zanesljivih partnerjev za uresničevanje svojih zamisli. Problem sem videl v relativni majhnosti posameznikovega socialnega kroga, ki zajema predvsem ljudi znotraj njegove glavne panoge.
		Sredi decembra sva se povezala z Blažem, ki je ravno takrat reševal tak problem. Skupaj sva pričela razvijati koncept ideje, ko se nama je pridružil tudi tretji član z istim problemom, ki trenutno ni več aktiven. 
		Do konca februarja smo koncept pripeljali tako daleč, da smo ga na Sedi 5 v Kinu Šiška tudi predstavili. Pozitiven odziv poslušalcev nas je motiviral, da smo se odločili, da projekt tudi realiziramo. Po predstavitvi se nam je pridružil tudi Jure in v začetku marca smo se lotili realizacije.' => '',
