  'The idea was born during the conversation that happened in October 2012 at PopUp home. Talking to one of the founders of Slovenia coworking made me realise that online platform could open up the concept of coworking to a broader community. It will help solving a problem of finding the right team to build new products and services. In mid December BlaÅ¾ joined me. He\'s been facing the same problem. It was difficult for him to find a realiable team of people outside his social circles. Soon after the third member joined our team. In late February 2013 the three of us developed and presented our concept to Slovenia\'s coworking community. Positive feedback gave us more than enough motivation to go on with the development of the web platform. Soon after our presentation the fourth member joined the team and the developement process.' => '',
